# Full Stack API Final Project


## Full Stack Trivia

This Trivia project made by udacity allows users to play a trivia game. Students in the FSND program were tasked to structure plan, implement, and test an API allowing it to perfoarm the following: 

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
